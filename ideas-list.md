### 🚀 1. **OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) SDK with Python**

**📅 Project Duration:** Long (~350 hours)  
**🔥 Difficulty Level:** Easy  
**👨‍🏫 Mentors:** Thilina Shashimal Senarath (thilinas@wso2.com), Omindu Rathnaweera (omindu@wso2.com)

**📍 Description:**  
This project aims to develop a Python SDK that simplifies the implementation of the Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) flow, as defined in the OpenID Connect (OIDC) specification. CIBA enables authentication processes where the end user interacts with a dedicated authentication device, separate from the client application, making it ideal for scenarios where the client device lacks a direct, secure interface for user interactions.

The SDK will abstract the complexities of interfacing with identity providers (IdPs) that support CIBA, including **WSO2 Identity Server** (WSO2 IS). WSO2 IS is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) solution designed to provide seamless authentication, authorization, and identity federation capabilities. By offering a streamlined, easy-to-integrate solution for initiating and managing backchannel authentication requests, the SDK ensures interoperability with any compliant IdP while enhancing overall security and usability.

Note that familiarity with the specification is not a prerequisite for the project.

**🛠 Possible Technologies involved:** 
- Python
- OAuth/OIDC protocols
- Identity and Access Management

**📚 Learning Materials:**
- [OpenID CIBA Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0-final.html)
- [WSO2 CIBA Documentation](https://ob.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/learn/ciba/)
- [Mobile Application for CIBA](https://ob.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/develop/mobile-application-for-ciba/)

**💪 Expected skills and technologies for the project:**
- Good understanding of Python programming language and its best practices.
- Understanding of CIBA specification.
- Understanding of WSO2 IS CIBA Flow.

### 🚀 2. **Financial-Grade API (FAPI) SDK**

**📅 Project Duration:** Long (~350 hours)  
**🔥 Difficulty Level:** Easy  
**👨‍🏫 Mentors:** Rivindu Madushan (rivindu@wso2.com), Madhavi Gayathri (madhavig@wso2.com)

**📍 Description:**  
This project focuses on developing a TypeScript SDK that enables secure and seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) supporting the Financial-Grade API (FAPI) standard. FAPI is designed to provide enhanced security, privacy, and interoperability for financial and high-security applications, making it ideal for use cases in open banking, fintech, and other regulated industries.

The SDK will simplify the implementation of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows compliant with FAPI, ensuring strong authentication, secure authorization, and fine-grained access control. It will offer built-in support for sender-constrained access tokens (MTLS/DPOP), Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR), Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), and advanced token handling mechanisms.

While optimized for integration with WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), this SDK will be designed to work with any IdP that complies with the FAPI standard, allowing developers to build secure and scalable applications across different IAM ecosystems. By abstracting the complexities of FAPI-compliant authentication and authorization, the SDK will provide developers with a streamlined, easy-to-use solution for implementing high-assurance API security in their applications.

Note that familiarity with the specification is not a prerequisite for the project.

**🛠 Possible Technologies involved:** 
- TypeScript
- OAuth/OIDC protocols
- Identity and Access Management

**📚 Learning Materials:**
- [FAPI Specifications](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/specifications/)
- [WSO2 Financial-Grade API Reference](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/references/financial-grade-api/)

**💪 Expected skills and technologies for the project:**
- Strong proficiency in the TypeScript programming language, along with best practices for scalable and maintainable development.
- Ability to read and interpret the Financial-Grade API (FAPI) specifications, ensuring compliance with security and interoperability standards.

**📅 Project Duration:** Medium-term (~175 hours)  
**🔥 Difficulty Level:** Easy  
**👨‍🏫 Mentors:** Vimukthi Rajapaksha (vimukthir@wso2.com), Lalaji Sureshika (lalaji@wso2.com)

**📍 Description:**  
This project focuses on improving the current ReactJS-based SDK on OIDC to support OAuth2 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) with fine-grained scopes, making it ideal for use cases in open banking, fintech, and other regulated industries.

The SDK will enhance the current implementation supporting OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows to include OAuth2 RAR, providing built-in support for fine-grained access control.

While optimized for integration with WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), this improvement will be designed to work with any IdP that complies with OIDC and OAuth2 RAR standards, allowing developers to build secure and scalable applications across different IAM ecosystems. By abstracting the complexities of OAuth2 RAR authorization, the improved SDK will offer a streamlined, easy-to-use solution for implementing high-assurance API security in applications.

Note that familiarity with the specification is not a prerequisite for the project.

**🛠 Possible Technologies involved:** 
- ReactJS
- OAuth/OIDC protocols
- Identity and Access Management

**📚 Learning Materials:**

**📅 Project Duration:** Long (~350 hours)  
**🔥 Difficulty Level:** Medium  
**👨‍🏫 Number of people:** 1  
**👨‍🏫 Mentors:** Anjana Supun (anjanas@wso2.com), Chiran Sachintha (chirans@wso2.com)

**📍 Description:**

The new templating feature will allow developers to create dynamic, reusable templates for generating diverse textual outputs—ranging from prompts, logs, and reports to email content and configuration files. The implementation should seamlessly integrate with Ballerina’s type system.

This templating engine will enable developers to generate dynamic content by allowing variable substitution, control flow (such as loops and conditionals), and the integration of custom functions. The scope includes designing an intuitive API, integrating the engine with Ballerina’s runtime, ensuring high performance and security, and providing thorough documentation and testing to support community adoption.

**🛠 Possible Technologies involved:**

### 🚀 9. **Ballerina CLI Support to Configure the Developer Environment**

**📅 Project Duration:** Short (~90 hours)  
**🔥 Difficulty Level:** Easy  
**👨‍🏫 Number of people:** 1  
**👨‍🏫 Mentors:** Asma Jabir (asmaj@wso2.com), Sameera Jayasoma (sameera@wso2.com)

**📍 Description:**  
Currently, the global configurations of the Ballerina developer environment are managed through a manually created `Settings.toml` file, which stores important settings such as access tokens for Ballerina Central, custom repository information, and retry configurations. However, there is no built-in CLI support for managing these configurations efficiently.

This project aims to introduce CLI commands that allow users to set, update, and retrieve global configurations for Ballerina without manually editing the `Settings.toml` file. The core implementation will involve developing a TOML configuration parser that maps CLI inputs to the correct TOML syntax. This parser will also serve as the foundation for CLI support for other TOML-based configuration files within Ballerina’s ecosystem.

**🛠 Possible Technologies involved:** 
- TOML
- Java
- Ballerina
- Gradle

**📚 Learning Materials:**
- [TOML Specification](https://toml.io/en/)
- [Ballerina Learning Materials](https://ballerina.io/learn/)

**💪 Expected skills and technologies for the project:**
- Experience with Java (or willingness to learn).
- Understanding of TOML file formats.
- Basic knowledge of command-line tools and argument parsing.
- Familiarity with Gradle-based projects (preferred but not required).
