## 📂 Native Inbound and Connector for IBM MQ 8.0

👤 **Contributor:** Hasitha Jayasundara  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Malaka Silva, djkevincr  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Currently, with WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus, the recommended way to connect to IBM MQ is using JMS transport. However, this approach has limitations and can sometimes cause issues when integrating. Identifying these limitations and providing a better solution is part of this project.

## 📂 Non-Occurrence of Events for Siddhi Patterns

👤 **Contributor:** Gobinath Loganathan  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Mohanadarshan, Grainier Perera, Suhothayan  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Siddhi provides an elegant solution to detect patterns among the events that happened. However, it cannot identify the absence of events using the pattern implementation. Instead, an alternative solution using Windows is suggested in the official document which is more complex than the regular patterns and less memory efficient when it comes to one-time pattern detection. The solution proposed here provides a native implementation for patterns to identify the events that do not arrive.

## 📂 OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol support for WSO2 Identity Server

👤 **Contributor:** Abilashini Thiyagarajah  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Ishara Karunarathna, Maduranga Siriwardena, Tharindu Edirisinghe  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol specification defines a set of rules to manage the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration which is already supported by the WSO2 IS. OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol describes how a client dynamically registered in the authorization server. But there can be situations where client needs to modify the registered data or check the current registration data or delete the data from the authorization server. So OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol came up with methods to enable the above functionalities. The primary scope of this project is to implement the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol in the WSO2 Identity Server.

## 📂 SCIM 2.0 Compliance Test Suite

👤 **Contributor:** Vindula Jayawardana  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Gayan Gunawardana, Omindu, Darshana Gunawardana  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

The proposal is on implementing the SCIM 2.0 compliance test suite which can be run on both the cloud and on premise by eliminating the limitations that can be seen in SCIM 1.1 compliance test suite. In the proposed test suite, it is expected to validate the supportability of a provided service provider, in terms of the SCIM 2.0 core specification and protocol specification.

The test suite should be able to generate a detailed analysis view and comprehensive report upon providing the server’s SCIM endpoint. The report should include the test results indicating the coverage percentage of each specification and a detailed view of the results of each test including requests sent by the test suite, expected response and the server response along with the indication whether a particular test is passed or not.

Apart from that the test suite should be run against WSO2 Identity Server to identify any gaps between the SCIM 2.0 specifications and Identity Server and provide improvements to the product.

## 📂 WS-Trust Implementation for IS 6.0.0 using Apache CXF Library

👤 **Contributor:** Isuranga Perera  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Malithi Edirisinghe, Johann Nallathamby, Kasun Gajasinghe  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

WS-Trust is a WS-* specification that provides extensions to the WS-Security specification. WS-Security provides the basic framework for message-level security in web services. WS-Trust builds on that base to specify a framework for broker trust across different security domains. It specifically deals with the issuing, renewing, and validating of security tokens, as well as with ways to establish, assess the presence of, and broker trust relationships between participants in a secure message exchange. 

This project focuses on implementing the WS-Trust specification for the WSO2 Identity Server 6.0.0 by simply integrating with Apache CXF.

## 📂 Eclipse Plugin for Siddhi

👤 **Contributor:** Udeshika Sewwandi  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Suhothayan, Nirmal Fernando  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

WSO2 Complex Event Processor (WSO2 CEP) is real-time and has a quick response time in identifying patterns in incoming streams of events/large data feeds with minimum storage. WSO2 CEP is popular among the community since it’s simple and easy to use as well as free and open source. The core of WSO2 CEP is Siddhi, which is a SQL-like query language used for complex queries. An Eclipse plugin for Siddhi is a valuable approach for the developer community since Eclipse IDE is widely used among developers. The Eclipse plugin for Siddhi will comprise syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error reporting, running, and debugging support for Siddhi based on Siddhi grammar using Xtext and Java.

## 📂 Siddhi Extension Doc Auto Generation

👤 **Contributor:** Nadun De Silva  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Suhothayan, Nirmal Fernando  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

This project consists of two main parts of the automated generation of documentation for Siddhi Complex Event Processing Engine.

a maven plugin for automated documentation generation for a single extension module or the siddhi core. The metadata annotated using the @Extension annotation are retrieved using the ClassIndex library which is already used by siddhi for indexing the annotated processor classes. Afterwards, documentation is generated using the metadata using a template engine.
Creating an index of the Siddhi Extension Repositories.
Adding and committing the docs/ directory content and the mkdocs.yml file to Git. Pushing the changes in the docs/ directory content and the mkdocs.yml file to origin master. Automatically deploying documentation in each new release of Siddhi.

## 📂 Python API for Siddhi CEP

👤 **Contributor:** Madhawa Vidanapathirana  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Grainier Perera, Anjana Fernando, Suhothayan  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

The scope of this project is to develop a Python API for the Siddhi CEP Java Library. Additionally, the developed Python API would be able to directly interact with the WSO2 Data Analytics Server through a REST API to simulate events and manage Siddhi Apps.

A Python API for Siddhi CEP would allow rapid prototyping, letting users realize the power of Siddhi with less time and effort. The advent of Python would make Siddhi CEP an attractive tool for Machine Learning and Scientific Research. Interfacing with the WSO2 Analytics Platform would allow users to model portions of their problems using Python scripts. The Python API would allow automated reconfiguration of Siddhi Apps in WSO2 DAS using Python scripts. The proposed solution would be compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x and would be ready for easy deployment via PyPI by the end of the GSoC coding period.
