## 📂 Document Based NoSQL Support for WSO2 Identity Server Database

👤 **Contributor:** Asantha Thilina  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Johann Nallathamby, Tharindu Edirisinghe  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

WSO2 Identity Server is the first Identity Server Bus in the industry which is capable of managing multiple user identities among applications, APIs, cloud, mobile, etc. One of the main components of the WSO2 Identity Server is user stores. Currently, WSO2 Identity Server supports user stores related to LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, and relational databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc. With the fast growth of enterprise adoption of NoSQL databases in the industry, WSO2 Identity Server needs to be expanded to support NoSQL databases. In this project, I will be implementing user store support for WSO2 Identity Server based on MongoDB, which is one of the most popular NoSQL databases in the industry today.

## 📂 SAML Assertion Query/Request Profile support for WSO2 Identity Server

👤 **Contributor:** Gayan Liyanaarachchi  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Omindu  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based security token used to exchange authentication and authorization data between two entities. It is one of the most widely used open standards to perform brokered authentication and web browser-based single sign-on. The "Assertion Query/Request Profile" defines a protocol for requesting dynamic or existing assertions by reference or by querying based on a subject and additional statement-specific criteria. This profile defines five major request/query message types which can be used to request assertions from the SAML authority:

- AssertionIDRequest
- SubjectQuery
- AuthnQuery
- AttributeQuery
- AuthzDecisionQuery

## 📂 Web (Javascript / D3) based BPMN editor to support a subset of commonly used BPMN constructs

👤 **Contributor:** Heshan Jayasinghe  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Isuru Wijesinghe  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard way of representing business processes in graphical representation. The purpose of this project is to implement a web-based BPMN editor to construct business process diagrams, which can be exported as a BPMN-2.0 compatible XML format. This BPMN diagrams can be built using components like tasks, events, and gateways. Users can implement their BPMN diagrams by dragging, dropping, positioning, resizing, deleting, and adding more details to the attributes. 

Constructed BPMN diagrams can then be exported as PNG/JPEG or a process definition XML file (BPMN 2.0 standard). The BPMN editor also supports the inverted process, which is uploading a standard BPMN model in XML format to generate BPMN process diagrams. 

This software has the capability to build complete business process diagrams and is also extensible to allow the construction of flow charts, chevron charts, and other graph-based diagrams.

## 📂 PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITH ONLINE DATA FOR WSO2 MACHINE LEARNER

👤 **Contributor:** Mahesh Dananjaya  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Supun, Maheshakya, Nirmal Fernando  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Machine Learning algorithms for data analysis make new areas such as Big Data analysis. Emerging data analysis with streaming data is one of the most paramount areas that will pioneer businesses in the future. WSO2 ML (Machine Learner) is one of the main platforms for building intelligent and predictive data analysis based on machine learning algorithms to support modern data transactions. 

Even though WSO2 ML is built upon the well-known Apache Spark MLLib, it still does not support streaming data. While Spark MLLib has streaming support for k-means clustering and generalized linear regression (GLR), it is developed with a Scala API. The purpose of this project is to develop a Java API to support streaming k-means clustering and GLR with mini-batch sampling techniques to handle streaming data without using Spark streaming. Therefore, the design includes a way to acquire streaming data and break those data streams into mini-batches, which can be used to retrain the models periodically with optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent algorithms.

## 📂 Integration Test Framework for WSO2 Dockerfiles

👤 **Contributor:** Abhishek Tiwari  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Chamila, Vishanth, Imesh Gunaratne  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

The WSO2 Dockerfiles project contains the Dockerfiles for all WSO2 products and allows users to build and run Docker images of these products. The Dockerfiles for all WSO2 products follow a standard structure and can also be customized to cater to specific requirements from various WSO2 projects. 

As the WSO2 Dockerfiles project is still under development, changes are constantly being applied to the codebase by multiple developers in the WSO2 community. To ensure the availability and robustness of WSO Dockerfiles, this project proposes to design and implement a general-purpose integration test framework for Dockerfiles, which provides features to write and execute integration tests effectively.

Developers will also be able to execute all the tests in the integration test suite locally to ensure that their latest changes did not break any existing functionalities and that there are no regressions. The integration test suite should also be extensible to work in conjunction with continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins), where these tests will be executed as a result of a recent check-in or pull request.

## 📂 Improve Production System Debugging Capabilities of WSO2 ESB (ESB Flight Recorder)

👤 **Contributor:** Dinanjana  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Isuru Udana, Chanaka Fernando  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus is a lightweight, high-performance, and comprehensive ESB. The WSO2 ESB effectively addresses integration standards and supports all integration patterns, enabling interoperability among various heterogeneous systems and business applications. 

When the ESB crashes, developers may want to gather several details from the server instance to investigate the reason. Currently, developers are required to perform this task manually, which can lead to complications, and they may not access relevant details. Although the JVM can be monitored through JMC or JConsole, this is not a sophisticated solution for the ESB. 

In this project, we are developing a standalone tool to monitor and report catastrophic events in a WSO2 ESB.

## 📂 RESTful Fine Grained Authorization-as-a-Service (AZaaS) for the WSO2 Identity Server

👤 **Contributor:** Manujith  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Pushpalanka Jayawardhana  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

The Identity Server currently supports SOAP as the service medium between its PDP (Policy Decision Point) and any PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) accessing it. Authorization requests from PEP should be sent to PDP to be evaluated through a SOAP service. In the scope of the project, a RESTful service is implemented along with the SOAP service.

## 📂 Contact Development Team feature in DevStudio

👤 **Contributor:** Nathiesha  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Jasintha, Kavith Lokuhewage  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Currently, Developer Studio users contact the development team via the WSO2 web support portal (Jira), requiring users to put in additional effort to send error logs, metadata, etc. The project goal is to develop a new plugin that allows users to contact the development team within the IDE itself. This plugin will be used to capture and report errors to the Development team (WSO2).

## 📂 HTTP Load Balancer On Top Of WSO2 Gateway

👤 **Contributor:** Venkat  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** IsuruR, Kasun Indrasiri  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

HTTP Load balancer is a software application capable of distributing HTTP traffic to backend servers according to the specified scheduling policy.

WSO2 Gateway is a high-performance, lightweight, low-latency messaging gateway based on the standard gateway pattern. Its Netty-based non-blocking IO and Disruptor (ring buffer) architecture make it the fastest open-source gateway available. Benchmarks show that the performance of the gateway is very high compared to other solutions and is close to the direct Netty-based backend (without any intermediate gateway).

The following features will be implemented:
- Support for different Load Balancing Algorithms
- Full Compliance with HTTP specification
- Support for SSL
- Session Persistence
- Health Checking and Redirection

This Load Balancer will be a pluggable component, achieving even load distribution through highly efficient, lightweight, and low-latency messaging. Thus, the performance will also be able to compete with existing load balancers.

## 📂 Ensemble Methods Support for WSO2 Machine Learner

👤 **Contributor:** Misgana  
🧑‍🏫 **Mentors:** Supun, Nirmal Fernando  
🏢 **Organization:** WSO2  

Ensemble methods combine predictions of base models in order to improve performance or generalizability over a single model. To this end, there are many approaches that either use averaging or voting over base model predictions. 

The main objective is to integrate ensemble support for the existing flow of the WSO2 Machine Learner. Implementation will include the following tasks:
- Implement an ensemble method(s) to combine multiple algorithms (particularly Stacking, Boosting, and Bagging).
- Create a UI to include the end-to-end flow of training the algorithm.
- Integrate it into the WSO2 Machine Learner.
